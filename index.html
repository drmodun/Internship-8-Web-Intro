                You might be surprised, as I was, to learn that Chrome exposes an API to notify
                you when the browser crashes on your page. It is part of a larger
                <a href="https://devdocs.io/dom/reporting_api">reporting API</a> that is designed to give
                browsers a channel to inform you, the developer, of crashes and other things.
            </p>

            <p>
            <p>In particular for a page crash you no longer have a page or JS context to
                receive the event, so the API instead POSTs some JSON to a URL you provide. Per
                usual there were
                <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/reporting-api-migration/">two slightly incompatible versions
                    of the API</a>,
                I imagine as they attempted to standardize. (I do not know a lot about this
                space but it appears all of this is Chrome-only for now…)
            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                Figma, which is a large complex web app that often breaks browsers, uses these
                to monitor for crashes. That is how I learned these systems existed — I was on
                call and an alert fired about the crash rate.
            </p>

            <p>
                And here is where the second surprise appeared: the alert fired because the crash rate was high, but a
                separate dashboard monitoring the crash rate appeared low. The discrepancy turned out to be caused by a
                misconfiguration. We were segmenting the incoming crashes by which portion of the site they affected,
                and the two systems slightly disagreed on what they were watching.
            </p>

            <p>
                The crash rate in the core app, the browser-busting magic WASM WebGL piece that I was attempting to
                monitor, had stayed level. The crash rate on a relatively static HTML marketing page had risen! The
                marketing page, as I recall, had some of those swoopy CSS animations on scroll that is common on today's
                marketing pages, and (edit: I had this wrong in the first post, thanks Andrew!) an accidental change in
                ad targeting was bringing in a bunch of users with lower-end mobile browsers that would crash.
            </p>

            <p>
                From this I took away an important lesson: even when your app is not pushing the
                boundaries of browsers, monitoring for crashes is probably worth it.
                <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/reporting-api/">Read this overview</a> to
                get started; I believe it's as simple as providing a <span class="specialText">default</span> endpoint in an
                HTTP header and accepting POSTs there.
